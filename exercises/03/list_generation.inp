matrix a = mnormal(1000, 1)  # 1000 standard normal variates
a = floor(a * 100)           # Convert to integers

# Alternatively: discrete integers between -100 and 100
#matrix a = mrandgen(i, -100, 100, 1000, 1)


# This will work:
scalar element = a[1000]
printf "Element 1000: %g\n", element

# This would fail (index out of bounds):
# scalar invalid = a[1001]
