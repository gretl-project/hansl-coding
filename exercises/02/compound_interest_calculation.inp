# Compound interest calculation
scalar initial = 100000
scalar rate = 0.035
scalar years = 5

# Method 1: Single formula
scalar final1 = initial * (1 + rate)^years

# Method 2: Step-by-step
scalar final2 = initial
loop i=1..years
    final2 = final2 * (1 + rate)
endloop

printf "Method 1: %.12f\nMethod 2: %.12f\n", final1, final2

scalar delta = final1 - final2
printf "Difference: %.16f\n", delta

scalar relative_delta = delta / final1
printf "Relative difference: %.16f\n", relative_delta * 100

# The results differ due to floating-point rounding at each step in Method 2
# while Method 1 does the calculation in one operation with different rounding.
